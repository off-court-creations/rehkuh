# Benchmark TSP Files (Legacy)

The `.tsp` files in this directory are **legacy benchmark files** that predate the current TSP format specification.

They may not conform to the current `docs/tsp-format.md` schema and will likely fail validation with the current `validateTSPFile()` function.

These files are preserved for historical reference only.

For current, spec-compliant examples, export a scene from rehkuh or refer to the examples in `docs/tsp-format.md`.
